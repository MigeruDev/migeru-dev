# .aiexclude
#
# This file specifies files and directories that AI agents should ignore.
# The syntax is identical to .gitignore.
#
# By excluding irrelevant, sensitive, or overly large files, you improve the AI's focus,
# enhance security, and reduce processing overhead.

# --- Security & Secrets ---
# NEVER commit or allow AI access to secrets, credentials, or private keys.
# This is the most critical section.
.env
.env.*
!.env.example
*.pem
*.key
credentials.json
secrets.yml

# --- Dependencies & Packages ---
# Exclude third-party code. The AI should focus on your source code, not its dependencies.
node_modules/
vendor/
bower_components/

# --- Lock Files ---
# Lock files are extremely verbose and not useful for understanding the project's logic.
# The package.json is sufficient for the AI to understand dependencies.
package-lock.json
yarn.lock
pnpm-lock.yaml

# --- Build Artifacts & Compiled Code ---
# The AI should analyze source code, not compiled or generated output.
/build/
/dist/
/out/
.next/
.vercel/
*.tsbuildinfo

# --- Logs & Temporary Files ---
# These are runtime files and contain no valuable information for code analysis.
*.log
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*
.pnpm-debug.log*
*.tmp
*.swp

# --- IDE & System Files ---
# These are specific to a developer's local environment and not part of the project's source.
.idea/
.vscode/
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# --- Large Assets & Binary Files ---
# Exclude large assets that are not source code to save processing time.
*.zip
*.tar.gz
*.mp4
*.mov
*.pdf

# --- Generated TypeScript Declarations ---
# These are auto-generated and don't need to be read by the AI.
